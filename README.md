To run my website you will also need to download the rails backend repo called 'portfoliosite_backend'

As this website hasn't been deployed to the internet, to run this site make sure you have node and ruby on rails installed. 

Run Instructions:
- Open 2 terminals
- Navigate 1 terminal to the directory of where you cloned the PortfolioSite repo, the second one will be for the portfoliosite_backend directory
- type npm run start on the PortfolioSite repo terminal and rails s -p 8000
- If both commands are successfuly executed, you should be able to access my website! (a browser window with my site should automatically populate and you should be able to view the contents of my site!)
