      "description": "The UML Editor was developed during my Software Development principles class (CSCD350). The goal for this class project was to work in teams of 5 or 6 while implementing object oriented programming concepts, learn the process of github, and incorporate the agile process. The quarter was partitioned into sprints where we had to satisfy given requirements as well as a 'real world' client who gave us feedback. The first half of the quarter was focused on developing the UML editor in the commandline while the second half was focused on a GUI iteration. UML Editor was developed using the Java language and the Java FX GUI library.",

      "body": "Today, I implemented a basic skeleton so that we can start developing pages for the application.\nThis include an app bar, nav bar, and 5 empty pages assigned to the nav bar buttons.\n\nThe app bar includes:\n       - title of the application\n       - hamburger menu button (no functionality as of current)\n\nThe nav bar includes:\n      - a nav button for five pages including: alerts page, map page, home page, calendar page, and accounts page\n\nThis was a great experience as I got a little more hands on experience with Flutter. I got to tinker with widgets - nesting them, and creating my own custom widgets for pages and the nav bar buttons. The nav bar button widget was designed to be reused - so this widget will take in a few arguments in order to work. Luckily, this cuts down on the effort needed to set up the UI.\n\n- Matt\n",
