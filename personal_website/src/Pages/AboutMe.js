                        My name is Matthew Matriciano. I am currently a senior at Eastern Washington University. 
                        I have been developing a passion for programming for the last 4 years.
                        My dominant interests in the realm of computer science is game development, software development, 
                        and more recently, web development. Outside of computer science, I have an eclectic set of interests and hobbies 
                        such as composing video game style music, collecting video games, reading philosophy, film making, writing, AI, mecha, animation, pixel art, low poly 3D, and more.
                        My goal is to be a software developer by day and a solo game developer by night. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        My passion for programming started with game development. Throughout my childhood, I was exposed to all different
                        kinds of video games, and what hit me first and for most was the music. I was mesmerized by how different 
                        the compositions sounded from your every day music, but was deeply inspired by the melodies that I heard. 
                        There was nothing like it. From there, I wanted to contribute my own sound to the medium; however, this 
                        would not occur until early college. About a year or two after learning guitar, I got ahold of some recording equipment
                        and a DAW and have been composing music ever since.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I composed many tracks and participated in contents placing somewhat high in a few of them; however, 
                        I was not satisfied with simply composing for video games. I had a lot of bigger ideas and other talents 
                        that I wanted to put to work. I have always been a story teller, and have tinkered with many different mediums
                        growing up - animation, art, writing, videography, the list goes on. It dawned on me that I could have my cake
                        and eat it too. The answer was game development; however, what terrified me was programming. As somone who didn't 
                        accel in mathematics as a kid, I was always intimidated by the art - however, I was not going to let that stop me. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/> 
                        In 2020, I had a great opportunity to learn programming working a small technician job for the firmware devOps group
                        at Itron during the 2019-2022 pandemic. I was tasked to learn the interpreted programming language "Python" (developed by the BDFL himself) so I could write
                        automation scripts for test environments. I bought a few cheap online courses and immediately fell in love with it. 
                        It felt like something I should have picked up years ago. As a natural problem solver, I was fascinated. At this time, 
                        I also made some online friends who were passionate about game development - who were also willing to spare time to ease me into 
                        the craft. It was very challenging by all means; however, the goal seemed more attainable than ever in my life. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        As I grew into my love for programming, I also realized the depth of my knowledge was too shallow, I wanted to do more with programming - perhaps a 
                        career. That's when I decided to go back to school to pursue a degree in computer science. I wanted to immerse myself in the craft
                        and do as much as I could. Attending school, I knew it was the right field for me scoring very high in my classes nearly getting straight As 
                        every quarter. Now as a senior, I am looking for opportunities to gain more experience within the field 
                        and to hopefully make it a life long career.
